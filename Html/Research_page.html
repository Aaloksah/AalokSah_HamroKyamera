            <p> <span style="color: #ff4f03; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Details:</span> This layout of Product
                Box has been stimulated from the Apple's official website. The round corner of the box with slight black
                shadow was so minimal and modern looking that we couldn't resist us from making the same design. This
                made us to implement this design in our website's Product Page with little bit of changes. At the end
                the final outcome was really satisfying and i can say that this was the best design out of all other
                inspired designs.</p>

                inspired from the image slider of Overlays.co website. It shows the most highlighted offers of the
                season. We also implemented similar image slider in our project by using a simple javascript code and
                some offer images obviously, which i made using canva templates. This was a great design which was fun
                to implement and this makes the website little bit dynamic</p>

            <p> <span style="color: #ff4f03; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Details:</span> We were very inspired
                from the product description page layout from SyBazzar.com website. We took idea from this page and
                implemented in our Product Information page of Hamro Kyamera website with some design modifications. The
                "Add to Cart" and "Buy Now" button was the key inspiration which we did same in our website. Beside
                that, the technique by which daraz differentiated the Old Price and Discounted Price was incredible.
                This was also implemented in our website the same way.</p>

                suggested and recommended products was also inspired from Daraz.com.np website. This is a good way to
                show the customer what similar products are available in this website. It helps the customer make good
                descision while purchasing from the product. Little modifications was done while implementing this to
                our website Product information page.</p>
